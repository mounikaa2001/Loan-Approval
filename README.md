# Loan-Approval

A loan is a financial contract where a lender provides
funds to a borrower, who agrees to repay the amount,
known as the principal, with added interest over a
predetermined period. The interest compensates the
lender for the risk and opportunity cost of lending. Loan
agreements outline terms such as the repayment
schedule, interest rate, and any associated fees. Loans
can be secured, requiring collateral as protection for the
lender, or unsecured, relying solely on the borrowerâ€™s
creditworthiness. Common types include personal loans,
mortgages, and auto loans. Failure to repay as agreed can
lead to penalties, damage to credit, and legal consequences.
